# TurboBus Progress

## Current State

Current main target: system implementation before experiments.

The system-level runtime path submits `TransferIntent`, uses daemon scheduling,
issues `ExecutionTicket` plans, and keeps the old `client_transfer.py` file
deleted. `TurboBusRuntimeSession.open()` is now the public system entry without
application-side relay selection: the target GPU is bound from registered CUDA
buffers and relay eligibility is discovered from the daemon before session
registration and profile bootstrap. Model loading, training offload, and
inference KV adapters now have runtime-session entry points. Worker service and
production process entry points route requests through the standard lifecycle.
vLLM connector save/restore tracing now requires real `TransferReceipt` handles
before it records receipt, decision, topology, or ticket ids.
vLLM saved prefixes are keyed by job id, session id, and prefix key, and the
connector binds externally created saved prefixes to its own job before storing
them.
Runtime session close now clears local buffer, target, relay, client, profile,
and registered-buffer state after daemon close succeeds, and also clears local
pending state when no daemon session was opened.
vLLM connector close now releases connector-owned saved prefixes, pending save
contexts, pooled CPU backings, connector metadata, global prefix-store entries
for the connector job/session, and its runtime session.
Daemon socket receipt wait and transfer reschedule paths now enforce
authenticated peer ownership before returning receipt state or replacing a
daemon-issued plan.
Daemon worker authorization responses now include an authorization timestamp,
and worker authorization rejects expired `ExecutionTicket` data before worker
execution can start.
The old `turbobus/worker/helper.py` and `turbobus/daemon/protocol.py` export
layers have also been removed. Server-only validation is deferred until after
the system implementation pass, so it no longer blocks code work in this stage.

## Completed This Round

- Added `authorized_at` to daemon-issued worker authorization responses.
- Added explicit ticket expiration validation for worker authorization payloads
  that came from the daemon socket path.
- Added a second freshness check immediately before the worker executor starts
  on authorization payloads that carried daemon authorization timing.

## Validation

- `python -m py_compile turbobus\daemon\server.py
  turbobus\worker\validation.py turbobus\worker\models.py
  turbobus\worker\lifecycle.py` passed.
- `python -m unittest test.python.unit.test_worker_authorization` passed.
- `python -m unittest test.python.integration.test_worker_helper` passed.
- `python -m unittest test.python.integration.test_client_worker_transfer`
  passed with one existing skip.
- `git diff --check` passed with only CRLF conversion warnings.

## Remaining Risk

- CUDA/native execution, vLLM integration behavior, and relay/pooled execution
  remain deferred until the full system implementation pass is complete.

## Next Main Target

Tighten cross-job isolation and daemon authority in the daemon/worker
production path while continuing code-first system implementation through
direct/backend ticket freshness, status evidence, and cleanup enforcement while
keeping server validation deferred.
